/i A dark fantasy-style emblem with the bold text "blp" in the center as the main focus. The letters are large, jagged, and carved from ancient metal or bone, slightly glowing with arcane energy. Below and around the text — pirate-themed ornaments: a grim skull with a tattered hat, crossed cutlasses, broken ship wheels, ropes, and torn sails. These elements form a rugged base and decorative sides but do not obscure or sit behind the text. The composition is moody, with subtle glowing mist and runes, rendered in a WarCraft-inspired fantasy aesthetic. Strong silhouette, high contrast, black background, and a cursed, iconic look.

Dark-fantasy abstract background of a forgotten system. No characters/buildings/trees.
Distributed multi-cluster layout; strictly no single emblem or dominant symbol.
Fill with many small hand-drawn motifs: pen-and-ink sketches, crosshatching + stippling, pencil tests, charcoal smudges, chalk scrawls, silverpoint scratches, dry-brush streaks; occult marginalia and unreadable pseudo-diagrams, blueprint linework fragments, runic doodles; micro-skull filigree (none >5% of frame), misty spirit wisps/orbs; thin broken rings, lissajous/rose curves, spirograph residues, Voronoi crack lines, isometric wireframe hints, faint moiré grids, particle dust, fBM fog.
Keep a calmer low-contrast mid-center for overlays; edge-weighted detail; layered translucency, subtle volumetric fog, soft bloom.
Painterly gothic-fantasy, gritty textures, filmic contrast.
Palette: soot black, deep teal/indigo, muted cyan, hints of magenta-violet and faint emerald glow.
